## 🔐 Quick Access Credentials

### 👨‍💼 Admin Account (Primary)
```
Username: admin  | Password: admin123 | Full Access
```

Optional legacy demo admins (registrar / dean) are NOT created by default anymore to keep the role model simple. To include them for demonstrations, set the environment variable before seeding:

Windows PowerShell:
```
$env:SEED_EXTRA_ADMINS="true"; python comprehensive_seed.py --students 50
```
They will be created with:
```
registrar / registrar123
dean      / dean123
```
All admin-like accounts share the same single role value: `admin`.

### 🎓 Sample Student Accounts (After Seeding)
```
ug10001 | 00012024 | Kwame Asante     | Computer Science
ug10002 | 00022024 | Ama Mensah       | Business Admin
